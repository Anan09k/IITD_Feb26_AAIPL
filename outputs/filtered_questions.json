        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The first letter alternates between A and C, then C and E, then E and G, and so on. The second letter is a number that increases by 1 in each step, and the third letter is the previous first letter. Therefore, the next term should follow this pattern, resulting in HI5G."

            "D) 7^5-5"
        ],
        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The pattern involves two separate series: the base of the exponent increases by 1 for each term, and the exponent is the position of the term in the series, while the subtracted number is the term's position minus 1. Hence, the next term should have a base of 6 and an exponent of 5, with 5 subtracted."

        "answer": "B",
        "explanation": "The series alternates between two interleaved patterns. The first pattern increments the first letter alphabetically and the second letter increases by 2 each time. The second pattern increments the first letter alphabetically and the second letter increases by 4 each time. Hence IJ_10L."

        "explanation": "The pattern involves two series: the first letter decreasing alphabetically (T, S, R, Q) and the second letter increasing alphabetically (E, D, C, B), with the number series increasing by 1. Hence, the next letter should be 'A' and the number should be '4'."

        "answer": "C",
        "explanation": "The first letter of each term follows alphabetical order. The second letter is the position of the first letter in the alphabet. The third letter alternates between C and E, and the fourth letter alternates between the first letter of the previous term and the first letter of the current term. Therefore, the pattern continues with IJ7H."
