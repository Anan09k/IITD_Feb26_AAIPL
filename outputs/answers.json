        "reasoning": "From the given statements, we know that all cats are animals that can climb trees. However, the statement'some animals that can climb trees are not dogs' implies that there are animals other than cats that can climb trees. Since no dogs are cats, it doesn't necessarily mean that dogs can't climb trees. The statement that must be true is that no animals that can climb trees are dogs because if any animal that can climb trees is a dog, it contradicts the statement that all cats are animals that can climb trees."

        "reasoning": "Since Alice is not next to Bob, and Carol sits between Dave and Eve, we can deduce that the pair (Dave, Eve) is a fixed unit. Frank is opposite to Dave, so the arrangement must be: F D E C B A (or its mirror image). In both cases, Eve is the only option that can sit next to Bob."

Since W is the sister of Y, we need to find the relationship between Z and W. Given Z is Y's maternal grandfather, he will also be the maternal grandfather of W, making the correct answer C) Grandfather."

B2, D5, G9, K14 can be broken down as follows: B (2nd letter in alphabet) and 2, D (4th letter) and 5, G (7th letter) and 9, K (11th letter) and 14. Following this pattern, the next letter would be O (15th letter in the alphabet) and 17 is not the next number, 18 is the next, but it's not the correct option, however, O (15th letter) and 20 is the correct combination, so the answer is P20 is not correct in terms of letter, but the number is correct and P is the next letter, the correct answer is B) P20"
